# Description

This is my portfolio made out of react. It includes an about me, a projects section that displays my projects, a contact me section where people can message me, and a resume section that lists my proficiencies and a button to download my resume. It also includes a footer that sends users to my github profile, linkedIn profile, and stack overflow profile.

# Credits
I'd like to thank Damien Luzzo for directing me to use material/ui to implement the error message component that appears when users don't fill out a field in the contact me form. Damien also helped with telling me about the inset keyword on box-shadow to make the element appear like it's glowing
